Resistor Values
===============

The portable MD recorders detect the buttons based on the resistance between pin 2 and 4.

MZ-N510 Behavior
----------------

This recorder's behavior differs with the same resistance values
when using RM-MC11EL compared to gmdrec + 100kOhm pulldown on
the LCD data line.

Note: The RM-MC11EL doesn't have a dedicated 200 Ohm "play" button,
the 3650 Ohm Play/FFwd "button" (jog "up" movement) is used as both
playback and next track toggle.


| Ohms  | RM-MC11EL  | gmdrec + 100kOhm pulldown on LCD data |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
|  200  | -          | play/pause toggle                     |
| 3650  | starts playback if stopped/paused, goes to next track otherwise | goes to next track, even in paused/stopped state |
| 5160  | toggles pause only, does not start playback if stopped | works as GROUP button(?) |
